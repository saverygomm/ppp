# To do list for the PPP test... 
- Compare PrioritisationIII with PrioritisationII and extract changes that have already been made.  
- one of these changes is the log.file argument.  Add that and save a log for the whole test script.  
- Set up an overlapping costs example.  
- Set up an example to test what happens with NA values in there.  
  - NA costs
  - NA successes
  - NA benefits
  - NA weights
- Column names?  

- Add a readme file.  
- Upload to Github with the actual PPP (no )
- Perhaps PPP just needs the optimization functions (not the data cleaning)
- Yes, cause that's the methodology we're suggesting using.  
- Email everyone about it and ask for suggestions.  
- Compile suggestions
- Finish the documentation.  

- Find out why 13 species are removed in Martina's script.  
  - run through "Data_setup_code, HP function.r" and see where the species are removed when the merging of the datasets occurs.  


# CHANGES.  
- all.costs can be the only thing fed into the PPP.  
- a.data doesn't need the Period1Costs columns... test the PPP without them added.
